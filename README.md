# RestaurantProject

This project is a simulation of a japanese restaurant, where:
 * The customer can order from 3 different types of items. 
 * The customer can view, add, and delete items from cart. 
 * Checkout is also implemented, with the simulation of "delivery" in a txt file with details of the order (the path may not work for you, please review it beforehand (line 578 of the program.cs)).
